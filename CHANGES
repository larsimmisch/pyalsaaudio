Version XXXXX:
- Return an empty string/bytestring when 'read()' detects an
  overrun. Previously the returned data was undefined.

Version 0.8.2:
- fix #3 (we cannot get the revision from git for pip installs)

Version 0.8.1:
- document changes (this file)

Version 0.8:
- 'PCM()' has new 'device' and 'cardindex' keyword arguments.

  The keyword 'device' allows to select virtual devices, 'cardindex' can be
  used to select hardware cards by index (as with 'mixers()' and 'Mixer()').

  The 'card' keyword argument is still supported, but deprecated.

  The reason for this change is that the 'card' keyword argument guessed
  a device name from the card name, but this only works sometimes, and breaks
  opening virtual devices.

- new function 'pcms()' to list available PCM devices.

- mixers() and Mixer() take an additional 'device' keyword argument.
  This allows to list or open virtual devices.

- The default behaviour of Mixer() without any arguments has changed.
  Now Mixer() will try to open the 'default' Mixer instead of the Mixer
  that is associated with card 0.

- fix a memory leak under Python 3.x

- some more memory leaks in error conditions fixed.

Version 0.7:
- fixed several memory leaks (patch 3372909), contributed by Erik Kulyk)


Version 0.6:
- mostly reverted patch 2594366: alsapcm_setup did not do complete error
checking for good reasons; some ALSA functions in alsapcm_setup may fail without
rendering the device unusable


Version 0.5:
- applied patch 2777035: Fixed setrec method in alsaaudio.c
  This included a mixertest with more features
- fixed/applied patch 2594366: alsapcm_setup does not do any error checking


Version 0.4:
- API changes: mixers() and Mixer() now take a card index instead of a
  card name as optional parameter.
- Support for Python 3.0
- Documentation converted to reStructuredText; use Sphinx instead of LaTeX.
- added cards()
- added PCM.close()
- added Mixer.close()
- added mixer.getenum()


Version 0.3:
- wrapped blocking calls with Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS/Py_END_ALLOW_THREADS
- added pause


Version 0.2:
- Many bugfixes related to playback in particular
- Module documentation in the doc subdirectory


Version 0.1:
- Initial version
